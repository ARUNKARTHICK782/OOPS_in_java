Static methods in interface:
    * The static methods in interface cannot be overridden.
    * This improves code reusability
    * If most of the implementing classes use a method with same logic then we can define the method inside the interface itself
    * The implementing class do not want to use this method compulsorily

Default methods in interface:
    * If we want to implement new method in the interface without affecting the already implementing classes we can use default
      methods.
    * The implementing class can override the method if they are not satisfied with the default implementation
