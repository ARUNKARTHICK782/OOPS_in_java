super() :
    * It is used to call the parent class members
    * In a method overriding scenario when we want to call the parent class method we'll use super to achieve this
    * The java compiler puts its own super() when we don't provide any.
    * It must be the first statement.

this() :
    * It is used to call another constructor from one constructor.

this :
    * It is used to call current class members
    * When parameter name is same as field name we'll use this keyword to differentiate the fields.
    * It must be the first statement.

Note :
    * A constructor cannot have both the super() and this() at the same time
    * this -> It is a keyword
    * this() -> It is a method call
