Abstract:
    It should have zero or more abstract methods
    Concrete methods can also be created in an abstract class
    It cannot be initiated
    Variable can be declared inside the abstract class

Interface:
    Advantages:
        * Abstraction
        * Multiple inheritance is possible only because of interface
        * Loose coupling
    All the methods in an interface is abstract by default
    It cannot be initiated
    Variables must be initialized in the interface


abstract class Temp{
    int a;
    abstract void sub();
    void add(){

    }
}

interface TempInterface{
    void add();
}

Method Overloading:
    When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.
